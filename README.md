# wlmcd

@wintersteiger's library for monitoring and configuring devices (various) on Raspberry PIs (mostly). Use at entirely your own risk; this has broken computers before and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

## Requirements

`sudo apt install build-essential libncurses-dev libssl-dev libgpiod-dev libdbus-1-dev libdbus-c++-dev`

## Build

make all

## Use

See `apps/*/Makefile` for examples.

### Documentation: None
### Warranty: None
### Support: None

### Contributions/PRs:

Welcome, but never without prior agreement. Nothing that @wintersteiger can't maintain himself. Expect multi-month PR review cycles.
